GitHub Pages deployment strategy that aligns with your goal: audio playback from a Samsung phone, routed to Bluetooth speakers, without relying on Samsung Music Share.

Since GitHub Pages only supports static websites, weâ€™ll need to build a web-based audio player using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript â€” no native Android code, but fully compatible with mobile browsers (including Samsung Internet and Chrome).

- No app installation needed
