GitHub Pages deployment strategy that aligns with your goal: audio playback from a Samsung phone, routed to Bluetooth speakers, without relying on Samsung Music Share.

Since GitHub Pages only supports static websites, weâ€™ll need to build a web-based audio player using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript â€” no native Android code, but fully compatible with mobile browsers (including Samsung Internet and Chrome).

ðŸš€ Goal: Web Audio Player on GitHub Pages

âœ… Benefits:
- No app installation needed
- Works on any browser (mobile or desktop)
- Can be paired with Bluetooth speakers via system settings
- Fully hosted on GitHub Pages â€” fast, free, and reliable

ðŸ§© Features Weâ€™ll Include

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| ðŸŽµ Audio Playback | Play local or hosted MP3/WAV files |
| ðŸ“± Mobile-Friendly UI | Optimized for touch and small screens |
| ðŸ”Š Volume Control | Adjust playback volume |
| ðŸ“‚ File Picker | Option to load local audio files |
| ðŸ§  No Dependencies | Pure HTML/CSS/JS â€” no frameworks required |
